    "text": "Introduction\n\nWhat is the topic of this guide, and why is it important?\n\nThe transformer is an attention-based network architecture that learns context and meaning by tracking relationships in sequential data like words in a sentence.\n\nWhat problem does this concept or paper aim to solve?\n\nSequence modeling and transduction problems such as machine translation have previously been solved by recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and long short-term memory networks (LSTMs). However, due to sequential dependency, the inherent nature of RNNs prevents its training from being parallelized.\n\nWhat are the main contributions or breakthroughs introduced?\n\nTransformers show significant improvements in both computational efficiency as well as model performance.\n\nHow does this fit into the broader context of the field?\n\nThis paper laid the groundwork for state-of-the-art models such as BERT and GPT which has revolutionized the natural language processing (NLP) field. Beyong NLP, transformers have successfully adapted to other machine learning domains like computer vision and reinforcement learning."
