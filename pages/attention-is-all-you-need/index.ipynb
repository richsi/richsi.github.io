    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The transformer is an attention-based network architecture that learns context and meaning by tracking relationships in sequential data like words in a sentence. Sequence modeling and transduction problems such as machine translation have previously been solved by recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and long short-term memory networks (LSTMs). However, due to sequential dependency, the inherent nature of RNNs prevents its training from being parallelized. Transformers also solve the vaninishing and exploding gradient problems from RNNs.\n"
